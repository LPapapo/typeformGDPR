## Intro


#### Problem to be solved/ User story

Typeform is a platform that is used to create forms. User responses are collected.
Many times, a user can request that his response be deleted in order to delete some personal information, such as his email address.(GDPR oriented)
A lot of manual work is required due to the lack of a global user search within Typeform.
All emails must be copied and pasted into each form one by one.
This manual process takes a long time.




#### How is it currently solved?

A Python script is written to solve this problem.
A Typeform API access token is generated, and all emails that have requested deletion are placed as input.
When you run the script, all forms are searched and a report is generated.





### How to use it ?

1. Make sure that you have the API access token placed in the config file . ( can be requested from ops)
2. While in the config file, you can change the response.deletion setting to true or false. If true, when he finds a requeried entry, it will be deleted automatically.
If set to false, it will only return the find result.(save the changes)![typeform1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97594496/186649820-916cbfa7-6f63-4adf-9608-048da796d940.jpg)
3. The next step is to open input.txt and copy all of the emails that need to be deleted into the txt file line by line.(save the changes)![typeform2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/97594496/186651169-9671abd5-854e-43db-8bf7-6e0fdd8a78d5.jpg)
